        <p class="center-text-one">Nozu is a simple image-based bulletin board where anyone can post comments and share images. There are boards dedicated to a variety of topics, from Japanese animation and culture to videogames, music, and photography. The purpose of Kaeru is to create communities between topics where discussion is allowed allowing everyone to voice their opinions.</p>
        <p class="center-text-two">This is what Nozu strives to be. An imageboard dedicated to a variety of topics, like 4chan and other sites. While Nozu may not find the same success as other imageboards, it will connect smaller, niche groups that will allow it to flourish.</p>
